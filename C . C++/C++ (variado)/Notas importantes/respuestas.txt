1. enum DXT {yes, yo = 16, cool, sweet, fast = 20, awesome, peep = 34, leet = 36};

What is the value of sweet?
18

2. int dxt = 1337;

int *pntr = &dxt;

What is the value of *pntr?
1337

3. What does the "|" do in this situation (786 | 560) - Explain and Answer

it compare the bits one to one.
if the above is equal to the number below the number down
if they dont match. it lowers the larger number

e.g:
int b= 786|560 = 818

4. What does the "NOT" do in this situation (450)? - Expalain and Answer in Binary
it is an unitary operator that reverses the value of each bit.

450 in binary is equal to 00000000000111000010 
so ill be  11111111111000111101 .

5. [1] int main () {

15. What does the "<<" bitwise operator do?
       Simply moving the bits to the left.

16. Create a class with a minimum of two 3 data members with private access, and 2 function mentions with public access.. and then implement it in a simple program that uses both the data members and the function members.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class persona
{
    private:
        char *a_nombre;
        int a_edad;
        int bh;
    public:
        void SetNombre(char *nombre)
        {
            a_nombre=nombre;
        }
        void SetEdad(int edad)
        {
            a_edad=edad;
        }
        void setbh(int bh1)
        {
            bh=bh1;
        }
        int  getbh()
        {
            return bh;
        }
        char* GetNombre()
        {
            return a_nombre;
        }
        int GetEdad()
        {
            return a_edad;
        }   
    };

int main()
{
    persona pj;
    char nombre[40];
    int bh;
    int edad;
    
    cout<<"Name: ";
    cin.getline(nombre, 40);
    
    cout<<endl<<"Age: ";
    cin>>edad;
    
    cout<<endl<<"Year born: ";
    cin >> bh;
    
    pj.SetNombre(nombre);
    pj.SetEdad(edad);
    pj.setbh(bh);
    
    cout<<endl<<"Your name is "<<pj.GetNombre()<<" and you have "<<pj.GetEdad()<<" years old.";
    cout<< "\nYou borned in: " << pj.getbh();
    
    setbuf(stdin, NULL);
    cin.get();
    return 0;
}




17. A for loop contains an ( initialization; [what goes here?]; increase):
Condition.

18. What do the statement "->" do?
This is for access to a member of a struct  referenced to a pointer.

19. Why doesn't a #define need a ";" after its end?
No semicolon (;) is expected at the end of a preprocessor directive.

20. Void has a type? True or False?
False
